This is my web development project, intended to try to create BUG BOUNTY program in LTU

I will use Python Flask as a backend and HTML CSS ans Bootstraps for UI/UX.
Infrastructure will be hosted on AWS using Ubuntu server as a VPS, Nginx for web app inself, and routed using Gunicorn.

I will try to update as I move along the development.

During the development stage, addresses to reach the APP are :

http://18.185.61.92:8080                                                                                                          
http://18.185.61.92:8080/login

These addresses will change - I will update (Updated 2023 08 15)
