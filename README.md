This is my web development project, intended to try to create BUG BOUNTY program in LTU

For my app I will use Python Flask for as a backend and HTML and CSS for UI/UX, also Blueprints.
Infrastructure will be hosted on AWS using Ubuntu server, routed using Gunicorn and Nginx

I will try to update as I move along the development.

During the development stage, addresses to reach the APP are :

http://3.76.106.39:8080                                                                                                          
http://3.76.106.39:8080/login

These addresses will change - I will updatre (Updated 2023 08 06)
